* Readline and Readexp

Note that readline can return just the '\0' char.  It may happen that
the readline get stuck and returns always repetetly if it can't read
any more characters.


* Bread functions

* TCP server with argument passing signal handler

* XDR - pay attention on allocating the data structure.  It's
  generally not done by the library. It's the caller responsibility to
  do so.

* As a general rule: always use fgets instead of fscanf.
  The former catches interupts, while the latter does not.
